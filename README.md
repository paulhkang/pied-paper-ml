This is a git repository containing files for a fake news classifier.

The three .ipynb files are different python scripts for MNIST classification, text preprocessing, and text classification, respectively.

The repository also includes the fake news dataset pulled from Kaggle, both in original (data/) and processed (preprocessed/) form.

This project was made as a continuation of a PyTorch hackathon with myself, Minyoung Na, and Daniel Park. It is submitted as the final project for CPE551 with Professor Iyengar.
